Strings are one of the most important data types in JavaScript. In this lesson we will introduce the concept of data types, we will learn what strings are, and how they are created.

In the previous exercises we have only worked with numbers. Numbers are one of multiple types of values that exist in JavaScript.

By assigning a number to a variable, the variable automatically has the type Number.
const num = 5;

We can use the typeof operator to find out the type of a value or variable. Try it out:
console.log(typeof 1); // number
const num = 1;
console.log(typeof num); // number

Great! But what if we do not want to store a number but some text in a variable?

Let's try it:
const text = hello;
console.log(text); // ReferenceError: hello is not defined


As you can see, this doesn't work. The browser thinks that hello is a variable.

If we want to store text, we must enclose it in single or double quotes or in backticks.
let text = "hello";
console.log(text); // hello
text = 'hi';
console.log(text); // hi
text = `bye`;
console.log(text); // bye

It doesn't matter if you use single or double quotes or backticks.

Let's check the type of a variable that stores text.
let text = "hello";
console.log(typeof text); // string

Awesome, we created our first JavaScript string.

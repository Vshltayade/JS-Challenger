In this lesson we will explore the concept of nested scopes. In JavaScript, you can create a scope whithin another scope. This creates a hierarchy of scopes, where the inner/child scope has access to the variables or functions defined in the outer/parent scope.

function outer(){
    let x = 12;
    function inner(){
        x = 13;
        log(x); // 13
        const y=7;
    }
    //log(y)
}

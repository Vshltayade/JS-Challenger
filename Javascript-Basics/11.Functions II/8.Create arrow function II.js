// Create an arrow function func. The block code that already exists expects two parameters x and arr. Declare them when you create the function.
// This exercise might look complicated at first glance, but you just have to apply what we have learnt about rest parameters and arrow functions.


const func = (x,arr) => {
    console.log(x,arr); // arr [1,2,3]
    
}

func('arr',[1,2,3]);

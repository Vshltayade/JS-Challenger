Now, we will learn how to create variables with const and look at the differences between let and const.

So far, we have created our variables with the let keyword.
let test = 5;

You can also create a variable with the const keyword.
const test = 5;

The difference between the two is that you can not assign a new value to a variable that was created with const.

Try it out. Here, we attempt to assign a new value to a variable that was created with const.
const test = 1;
test = 2;
TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

Correct! It throws an error.

You also cannot declare a const-variable without assigning a value to it directly. See what happens if you try anyway:
const test;
SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration

Let's wrap this up with some questions.

What will be the output?
let num;
num = 2;
console.log(num); 2

What will be the output?
const num;
num = 5;
console.log(num);
Uncaught SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration

What will be the output?
const num = 2;
num = 6;
console.log(num);
Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable

But, why should you use const instead of let?

It is considered good practice to use const for variables whoose value will never change.

For example, if you want to store the number pi you would use const to store it because pi never changes.
const pi = 3.14159;

Doing so can prevent your code from behaving unexpectedly.

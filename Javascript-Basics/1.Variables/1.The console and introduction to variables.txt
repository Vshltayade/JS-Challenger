Before we begin with variables, we have to talk about the console.log() statement.

console.log(1); -> 1

As you can see, console.log() simply displays information in your JavaScript console â€” in this case the value 1.

We will use console.log() as a tool to test our code.

Great! Now, we can talk about JavaScript variables.

Variables are containers that store information for later use.

Let's create our first variable:
let test;

We use the let keyword to declare a variable with the name test. Declaring a variable is JavaScript slang for creating a variable.

But, what happens if we use console.log() to log our new variable?
let test;
console.log(test); -> undefined

The console prints undefined. This is because we have not initialized our variable. Initializing a variable is the process of assigning a value to it.

We can assign a value to a variable with the assignment operator =.
let test;
test = 1;
console.log(test); -> 1

Great! Now, we have created a new variable and assigned it the value 1. We have also used console.log() to access this value.

You can also assign a value to a variable directly when you create it.
let test = 1;
console.log(test); -> 1

What will be the output?
let num;
console.log(num); -> undefined

What will be the output?
let num = 0;
console.log(num); -> 0
num = 2;
console.log(num); -> 2

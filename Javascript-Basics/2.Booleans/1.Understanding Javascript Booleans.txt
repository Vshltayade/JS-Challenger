In this lesson you will learn about JavaScript booleans. Just like numbers, booleans are a data type. They simply indicate if something is true or false.

In the previous sections you learnt how to create variables and assign numbers to them â€” like this one that indicates the price of an arbitrary product:
const price = 10;

But, sometimes you might want to store information that cannot be represented by a number.

For example, the product for which we already have a price could sometimes be on sale and sometimes not.

To store this kind of information we can use JavaScript Booleans, like so:
const isOnSale = true;

The value true indicates that the product is on sale.

Booleans can have only two values: true and false

If the product is not on sale, we assign false:
const isOnSale = false;

The same way we can reassign variables with numbers, we can also reassign variables with Booleans. Let's try it:
let isOnSale = true;
console.log(isOnSale); -> true
isOnSale = false;
console.log(isOnSale); -> false

What will be the output?
let isOnSale = false;
console.log(isOnSale); -> false
isOnSale = true;
console.log(isOnSale); -> true

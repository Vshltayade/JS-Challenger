JavaScript conditionals enable you to write dynamic and interactive programs that can respond to user input and other changing variables. Let's have a look at how they work.

Imagine we have the following variable:
let temperature = 75;

The value of this variable will most likely change over time.

Now imagine that you want to inform the user of your application if it is warm outside â€“ let's say if the temperature is above 70.

That's where we use our first if-statement. Run the code to see what happens.
let temperature = 75;
console.log(`The temperature is ${temperature}`); // The temperature is 75
 
if (temperature > 70) {
   console.log("It's warm outside"); // It's warm outside
}


That's right, since the temperature is above 70, our little program logs that it's warm outside.

Now, the temperature has changed. Let's see what happens.
let temperature = 60;
console.log(`The temperature is ${temperature}`); // The temperature is 60
 
if (temperature > 70) {
   console.log("It's warm outside"); // 
}

Since the temperature is not above 70, the log statement is not executed.

But, how does it work?

The if-statement executes a block of code if a certain condition is true. It consists of the if keyword followed by a condition in parentheses, and a block of code in curly braces.
if (Condition) {
 Block of code
}


Let's see if you understood.

What will be the output?
let num = 10;
 
if (num >= 10) {
   num = num + 5;
}
 
console.log(num); // 15



What will be the output?
let test;
 
if (false) {
   test = 'test';
}
 
console.log(test); // undefined
